SCSS Module Library
=========

This is a collection of SCSS modules for the most common UI patterns that I've come across in my own personal web app projects.

There's some use of Compass library which I may remove over time but really is just for prefixing and build commands.

This project is inspired by:
- [the original 360andup]('https://github.com/malarkey/320andup/')
- [the original inuit.css]('https://github.com/inuitcss')
- [Foundation grid]('http://foundation.zurb.com/')

Suggestions welcome.
