# Zero: A copy-paste-design module library

This is a collection of SCSS (and a little JS) modules for the most common UI patterns that I've come across in my own personal web app projects. It is barebones, meaning you design it to suit your project. The goal is to keep a library of modules that I (or you) can copy and plug into a new project and then apply appropriate styling.

[See the demo page](http://jorgepinon.github.io/scss-module-library/).


There's some use of Compass library which I may remove over time but really is just for CSS prefixing and local development.

This project is inspired by:
- [the original 360andup]('https://github.com/malarkey/320andup/')
- [the original inuit.css]('https://github.com/inuitcss')
- [Foundation grid]('http://foundation.zurb.com')
- [Twitter Bootstrap]('http://getbootstrap.com')

Suggestions welcome.
